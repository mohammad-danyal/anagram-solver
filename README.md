# anagram-solver
Anagram code kata. Searches a word list to find all two-word anagrams for an inputted word.

## Setup

'WordList.cs' will need modifying with the relevant file path in order to work correctly.

## Word List  

The word list I have used for this project is taken from here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words. 

However, the program will work with other word lists provided they are in a .txt file.
